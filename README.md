glassdoorJobAPI
===============

## About
    This is a project I used to help myself learn some python.
    
    This script will scrape job listings off of Glassdoor and get you information such as: Title of Job, Company, Location, Description (HTML), etc.
    I'm a senior undergraduate student who's fairly new to professional software development and even Github. So if you have any suggestions, advice, or comments for me feel free to connect via LinkedIn or Email.
    I'm also looking for a job so that's one of the motivations for me developing this script ;). Note: this is an older version of what I use for my website (Soon to be launched), which inserts directly to MySQL. So if you need help converting the script to insert to your DB just let me know and I'll help!
